# Results Page Refinement Requirements

## Overview
The user wants to refine the results page of the sacred sexuality quiz to provide more personalized recommendations and guide users toward their tantra programs. The refinements focus on enhancing the results presentation with book recommendations and clear calls to action.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Maintain Current Elements
- Keep the archetype distribution bar graph
- Keep the strengths section in bullet points
- Keep the orgasmic living category section

### 2. New Section: Growth Areas
- Add a new section after Strengths
- Format as a short bullet list
- Content should be tailored to the user's dominant archetype
- Purpose: Show users where their spiritual/sexual growth edge is

### 3. Book Recommendations
- Add two book recommendation sections:
  - "Go Deeper" - Book aligned with their strongest/dominant archetype
  - "Your Growth Edge" - Book aligned with their lowest-scoring archetype
- Each book recommendation should include:
  - Book title and author
  - One-line summary
  - Book cover image
  - Purchase link (Amazon)
- Book recommendations should follow this mapping:
  - Heart-Dominant: "Acupressure for Lovers" by Michael Reed Gach
  - Primal-Dominant: "Urban Tantra" by Barbara Carrellas
  - Energy-Dominant: "The Multi-Orgasmic Man/Woman" by Mantak Chia (gender-specific)
  - Mind-Dominant: Not explicitly specified, but likely "From Sex to Superconsciousness"
- Growth Edge books should be selected based on the user's lowest-scoring archetype

### 4. Call to Action
- Add buttons for their courses:
  - "Tantra Teacher Training"
  - "Tantra for Couples â€“ Coming Soon"
- Links should open in a new tab
- Use clear, contrasting but sensual colors

### 5. Design Elements
- Use clear labels and hierarchy for each section
- Recommended fonts: Playfair Display for titles, Open Sans or Lora for body text
- Maintain the existing color scheme for consistency

## Implementation Considerations
1. Need to determine the weakest archetype in addition to the dominant one
2. For Energy-Dominant results, may need to consider adding a gender question to the quiz to show the appropriate book
3. Ensure all book covers can be accessed and displayed properly
4. Maintain mobile responsiveness with the new elements
5. Ensure the layout remains clean and organized with the additional sections
